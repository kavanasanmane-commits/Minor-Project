student marks analyzer using python and numpy 

Take input for the number of students (n) and number of subjects (s) — the same for all students.

For each student, loop through all subjects and take marks as input, summing them to get the total marks for that student.

Calculate the average marks of each student by dividing the total by the number of subjects and store it in a list.

Convert the student averages list into a NumPy array for easier mathematical operations.

Use NumPy functions to find total of all students’ averages, overall average, highest average, and lowest average.

Assign a grade based on the overall average using conditional statements (if-elif-else).
